Using git for your work
=======================

What is git
-----------

Git is a *local* database for storing directories full of primarily textual documents. At any point, a 'snapshot' of the directory can be made and snapshots are maintained in a history which is a directed acyclic graph.

The above is a concise but unhelpful description of git. It certainly covers what git is but doesn't help you know why and how you should use it.
