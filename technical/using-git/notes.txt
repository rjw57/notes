William Whewell's Hypothetico-deductive model of the Scientific Method

# Gather data (observations about something that is unknown, unexplained, or new)

# Hypothesize an explanation for those observations.

# Deduce a consequence of that explanation (a prediction). Formulate an
  experiment to see if the predicted consequence is observed.

# Wait for corroboration. If there is corroboration, go to step 3. If not, the
  hypothesis is falsified. Go to step 2.

Metropolis Hastings

# Start with some state which is a sample from your distribution

# Propose a new state

# Calculate an acceptance parameter denoting how likely it is that this state is accepted.

# If not accepted, got to 3 otherwise go to step 2

The scientific method is essentially a Monte Carlo optimisation procedure.

Why do particle filters work better than straight-forward MH? Co-ordinated branching and merging strategies. A model for how scientists _really_ do research and how complex systems really evolve.

git lets the computer do the hard work so you don't have to

Developed primarily for software engineering but works well for any research whose state can be summariesed by a folder on your hard-disk.
