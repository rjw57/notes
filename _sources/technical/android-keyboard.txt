Remapping a Bluetooth keyboard on Android
=========================================

I have a Bluetooth keyboard from my Android device which I am very happy with except that the keyboard itself has no
Escape or Tab keys on it. The former isn't so much of a problem because I can use Ctrl+[ in vim in place of Escape.  The
latter is if you spend any time in the terminal.

I found a `guide <http://chris.boyle.name/2010/08/android-keymaps>`_ on re-mapping the AAndroid keyboard but it needs a
little updating for Jelly Bean (the version which I have on my Nexus 7).

Firstly, you'll need to have a rooted device and access to the ``adb`` command.  The Android keyboard layouts are stored
in the ``/system/usr/keylayout`` directory. The defauly keyboard layout which we'll be modifying is
``/system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl``.

Connect your device via USB, having made use USB debugging is turned on, and use the ``adb`` tool to download the
original file to your machine:

.. code:: console

    $ adb pull /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl

This file has a reasonably obvious format. I modified mine to replace Caps Lock with Left Control and re-mapped the Left
Control to Tab. My :download:`modified layout <android-keyboard/Generic.kl>` is available for download and is, like the
original, licensed under the Apache 2.0 licence. Obviously you should keep a backup of the original file in case of
disaster.

Once you have modified your layout, push it to your device. You cannot write directly to ``/system`` since the
filesystem is mounted read-only. For the moment, we'll copy it to the SD card:

.. code:: console

    $ adb push Generic.kl /sdcard/Generic.kl

Now you'll need to run some commands on the device either via ``adb shell`` on on a terminal emulator running on the
device. In either case you'll need to be the ``root`` user. This is usually done via the ``su`` command.  Then make the
``/system`` partition read-write, copy the new keyboard layout and restore the read-only nature of ``/system``

.. code:: console
    
    $ su
    # mount -o remount,rw /system
    # cp /sdcard/Generic.kl /system/usr/keylayout
    # mount -o remount,ro /system

Now your keyboard should have your custom mapping.
