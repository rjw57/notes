These are a collection of notes I make on interesting topics as I approach
them. These are mainly for my own use but I've decided to publish them a) for
backup purposes and b) to learn how the `GitHub pages`_ system works.

.. _`GitHub pages`: http://pages.github.com/

You may search these documents via the :ref:`search`.
