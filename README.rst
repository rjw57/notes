These are a collection of notes I make on interesting topics as I approach them. These are mainly for my own use but
I've decided to publish them a) for backup purposes and b) to learn how the `GitHub pages`_ system works.

Unless you're interested in the source code, got to http://rjw57.github.com/notes to see them in all their glory.

.. _`GitHub pages`: http://pages.github.com/

Hacking
-------

If you want to hack on these notes, you'll need the following things installed:

- GNU Make (which you probably already have)

- `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, version 1.1 or later for MathJax support

Run ``make`` to make the notes.
