<h1>Using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> for your work<a class="headerlink" href="#using-git-for-your-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a talk about why you should be using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> in your research. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt>
is not a tool which will make your research any <em>better</em> but it is a tool which
will let you make mistakes with less catastrophic side-effects.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> belongs to a family of tools known as &#8216;source-control&#8217; or
&#8216;source-management&#8217; systems. This is a rather poor term for it. I prefer to call
it &#8216;the best backup system you will ever use&#8217;. With <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> automated backups
and restoration become utterly trivial and, best of all, there are free
providers out there who will host private or public <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> backups for you.</p>
<p>So with that in mind. Let&#8217;s look at some of the high-level advantages of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="section" id="you-can-put-right-what-once-went-wrong">
<h3>You can put-right what once went wrong<a class="headerlink" href="#you-can-put-right-what-once-went-wrong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the television show <em>Quantum Leap</em> the intrepid scientist Dr Samuel Beckett
would travel in time in order to write supposed wrongs which happened to good
people. In the tradition of 20-20 hindsight it was impossible to see at the time
what seemingly innocuous activity would cause the heroine of the week&#8217;s life to
go wrong but with the help of knowledge from the future, Sam could travel back
and fix the Universe.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> lets you do this with your own research. It provides a safe ground for
you to explore ideas, perform destructive re-factoring or try out some
algorithmic improvement safe in the knowledge that if it ends up not working
out, you can go back to the point where you made the mistake and rectify it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-can-use-both-lanes">
<h3>You can use both lanes<a class="headerlink" href="#you-can-use-both-lanes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> allows for multi-tasking. You may be developing one idea and <em>branch</em>
off at any point to develop a new direction or new though. You can keep
developing the old branch as well and only merge back when you know which
direction is worth keeping. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> provides sophisticated automated algorithms
for merging branches allowing you to make use of insights gained in all branches
of development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backups-no-problem">
<h3>Backups? No problem<a class="headerlink" href="#backups-no-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> is a <em>distributed</em> system. In this case this word means that no`one
place is special. Your backup is itself a full`featured <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> repository just
as the repository on your own disk is. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> provides tools to synchronise
between remote repositories meaning that your backup and your main work space
are just as good as each other. Disaster recovery involves only syncing your
backup back to a fresh checkout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-searchable-database-of-your-code">
<h3>A searchable database of your code<a class="headerlink" href="#a-searchable-database-of-your-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> provides a very powerful command known as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">grep</span></tt> which can search
all of your code in an instant for any word or phrase you desire. Moreover it
can search any <em>version</em> of your code back in time to see where something was
mentioned or defined first.</p>
<p>There is also a valuable tool known as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">blame</span></tt> which can mark every line
of your code with the exact date and time it was written and give you access to
a message you wrote at the time describing the change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m going to assume you&#8217;re using a Unix-alike Operating System. If you&#8217;re not,
you&#8217;re already doing it wrong. Just before the OS X and Windows haters get to me
though, I&#8217;m going to point out that both the Mac and Windows platforms can be
Unix-like with some effort.</p>
<p>On the Mac, this effort is small: install <a class="reference external" href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a> and then install <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> via
the homebrew installation utilities. On Windows this is a little less involved:
install <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a> which will install <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> for you along with a nice
command-line interface.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is certainly possible to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> without ever touching the
command-line. Indeed if you have a good text-editor it may well support
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> directly. In the absence of editor integration it is far easier to
interact with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> via the command-line. It is better to describe what you
want to do with what where rather than to wave your hands around and grunt.</p>
</div>
<p>On Linux machines your distribution&#8217;s package manager will support installing
git. Usually this is via one of the following sets of magic runes:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> pacman -Ss git        <span class="c"># ... for Arch Linux</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install git   <span class="c"># ... for Ubuntu or Debian Linux</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> yum install git       <span class="c"># ... for Red Hat, Fedora or SuSe Linux</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>.</p>
