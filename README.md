These are a collection of notes I make on interesting topics as I approach
them. These are mainly for my own use but I've decided to publish them a) for
backup purposes and b) to learn how the [GitHub
pages](http://pages.github.com/) system works.

Unless you're interested in the source code, got to
http://rjw57.github.com/notes to see them in all their glory.

Hacking
-------

If you want to hack on these notes, you'll need the following things installed:

- GNU Make (which you probably already have)

- [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/), version 1.1 or later for MathJax support

- LaTeX + tikz/pgf (I use [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/>))

- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) for converting tikz figures into PNG

Run `make` to make the notes.
