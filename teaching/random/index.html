<h1>The meaning of &#8216;random&#8217;<a class="headerlink" href="#the-meaning-of-random" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This note addresses a very common misconception about the word &#8216;random&#8217;. Or, rather, it discusses two separate concepts
which are often combined into the same word: <em>randomness</em> and <em>uniformly distributed</em>.</p>
<p>What is the difference? Why should I care? Surely it only matters to pedants and mathematicians. The problem is not one
of being &#8216;right&#8217; or &#8216;wrong&#8217;. It is one of being able to express yourself to other people: you can&#8217;t talk about something
if you can&#8217;t name it.</p>

<h2>A real-world example<a class="headerlink" href="#a-real-world-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A podcast which I listen to&#8212;I wont name it&#8212;recently ran a competition to win a laptop. They proudly proclaimed that
they were going to let the machine itself pick its new owner. They wrote a program which would electronically pick a
name from a hat and that person would win that laptop. Being an Open Source podcast, they provided the source for their
program. I&#8217;m going to re-state their program in terms which are easier to understand. This &#8216;program&#8217; only works if there
are no more than 6 people in the competition, but the principle is the same as the real example.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Assign each competitor a (unique) number from zero to the number of entrants. The first competitor is &#8216;0&#8217;, the second
&#8216;1&#8217;, and so on.</li>
<li>Throw a six-sided die and write down the result.</li>
<li>Divide the number your rolled by the number of competitors and write down the remainder.</li>
<li>Give the laptop to the competitor with that number.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, suppose that there are four competitors: 0, 1, 2 and 3. We throw the die and get a 5. The remainder after
dividing 5 by 4 is 1 and so competitor 1 gets the laptop.</p>
<p>Can you see the flaw? Don&#8217;t worry if not. It&#8217;s subtle. I&#8217;ll explain it in a moment but back to the story: I sent the
producers of the podcast a polite, and jokey, note pointing out that the competition was (very, very, very slightly)
unfair and that, if they were my students, they&#8217;d have had a frowning face drawn on their work. I also noted that I
didn&#8217;t want them to fix it since the flaw was in my favour. I got the reply back that it didn&#8217;t matter because the
result was &#8216;random&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yes indeed, it was random but it was unfair. Have you spotted how? Well, let&#8217;s write down a table of possible die rolls
and the winner of the laptop:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="67%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Die</th>
<th class="head">Winner</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>4</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>5</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>6</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Is this fair? Entrants 0 and 1 have a 2/6 or one in three chance of winning whereas entrants 2 and 3 only have a one in
six chance. If the entrants are allocated a number on a first come first served basis then the competition is biased in
favour of those who entered early.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-distribution">
<h2>Uniform distribution<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-distribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So, the competition result was indeed <em>random</em> but was it <em>fair</em>? No. But no-matter how much I tried to explain, I kept
running up against the brick wall of misunderstanding: I was telling them it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;random&#8217; but it <em>was</em> &#8216;random&#8217;
because no one could predict the result.</p>
<p>Well, yes. The word &#8216;random&#8217; does indeed mean that; a random variable is one whose value cannot be precisely predicted
before you measure it. A person&#8217;s height is a random variable. Before you measure it, you don&#8217;t know what a person&#8217;s
precise height it. You can certainly put bounds on it; if you&#8217;ve not seen them you can reasonably suppose it will be
between 1 and 8 feet.</p>
<p>All heights are not equally likely. For example, you would expect there to be far more men whose height is in the range
5-6 feet than those who are 4-foot something.</p>
<p>When we have a random variable where all values in a range are equally likely we call it <em>uniformly distributed</em>. A
(fair) die is uniformly distributed. You would expect the likelihood of rolling a six to be the same as that of rolling
a one.</p>
<p>So, next time you are complaining&#8212;or being complained to&#8212;about something being &#8216;unfair because it isn&#8217;t random&#8217;, ask
yourself if you mean it isn&#8217;t random or that it isn&#8217;t uniformly distributed.</p>

<h2>Too long; didn&#8217;t read<a class="headerlink" href="#too-long-didn-t-read" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The conclusion you should take from this note is that &#8216;random&#8217; is not the same as &#8216;uniformly distributed&#8217;:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <strong>random</strong> variable is one whose precise value cannot be predicted before your measure it.</li>
<li>A <strong>uniformly distributed</strong> variable is one whose values are all equally likely.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-distributions">
<h2>Other distributions<a class="headerlink" href="#other-distributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A variable can be random and non-uniformly distributed. Coming back to our example of heights, the height of a person is
indeed random but we expect values to be clustered around some average. We call this pattern of values a <em>distribution</em>.
If we take lots of values of a random variable, we call it sampling and each value, which we call a <em>sample</em>, is said to
be <em>drawn</em> from the underlying distribution.</p>
<p>The rolls from a fair six-sided dice are samples drawn from the uniform distribution of whole numbers between 1 and 6
inclusive. The heights of the human population can be approximated as samples drawn from something called the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="epilogue-uniform-random">
<h2>Epilogue: uniform <span class="math">\(\ne\)</span> random<a class="headerlink" href="#epilogue-uniform-random" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose I give you the following sequence of numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, <span class="math">\(X\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Can you predict what number should go in place of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>? I hope it&#8217;s obvious that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is 5. You can predict
these numbers; they are not random. If <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is 5, however, then there are three of each number. By our definition
above they are uniformly distributed.</p>
<p>Usually, to be fair, a competition result needs to be <em>both</em> random <em>and</em> uniformly distributed. One rarely suffices on
it&#8217;s own.</p>
