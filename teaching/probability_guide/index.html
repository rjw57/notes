<h2>What is a ‘probability’?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-probability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Probability is a tricky beast to define. There are two ways of viewing what the probability of an event <span class="math">\(A\)</span>
actually is. These are termed the <em>frequentist</em> and <em>Bayesian</em> viewpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A frequentist views the probability of an event, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> as the ratio between the number of times that <span class="math">\(A\)</span>
happened (was true) and the number of times <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or not <span class="math">\(A\)</span> happened:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boxed{ P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(A) + n(\lnot A)} }\]</div>
<p>Notice how we’ve used <span class="math">\(n(A)\)</span> to mean ‘the number of times <span class="math">\(A\)</span> happened’ and <span class="math">\(\lnot A\)</span> to mean ‘not
<span class="math">\(A\)</span>’.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Bayesian views the probability of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> as measure of our belief that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is true. They use <span class="math">\(0\)</span> to
show absolute certainty in <span class="math">\(\lnot A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span> to show absolute certainty in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Either viewpoint can be valid. Should <span class="math">\(A\)</span> represent a single result from many trials, for example tossing a coin
and getting a Tail, the frequentist approach is intuitive and useful. Should <span class="math">\(A\)</span> represent a single true/false
statement, for example ‘this drug is more effective than a placebo’, the truth of the statement does not change each
time you ask the question. In such cases thinking of probability as a measure of belief makes sense. Which view of
probability is useful depends on the problem being addressed.</p>
<p>Also, did you notice the equation up there was boxed? I’ll put equations which are <em>very</em> useful definitions and terms
to learn in boxes like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="random-variables">
<h2>Random Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#random-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Very often one will be asked to find the probability of some <em>random variable</em> having a particular range of values. A
random variable is just some number (or, in general, sets of numbers) we can observe or measure in some process. For
example, a person’s height is a random variable: until we measure it, we cannot say with certainty what it is.</p>
<p>Usually a random variable is denoted with a capital letter and a particular observation of that random variable with a
lower-case letter.  For example we may use <span class="math">\(H\)</span> to mean ‘the height of a person’ and <span class="math">\(h\)</span> to mean ‘the
measured height of a particular person’.</p>
<p>For example we can read <span class="math">\(P(H \le 180\mbox{cm})\)</span> as ‘the probability that the height of a person is less than or
equal to 180cm’.  Similarly we can read <span class="math">\(P(H \le h)\)</span> as ‘the probability that the height of a person is less than
or equal to <span class="math">\(h\)</span>’. Notice how <span class="math">\(H\)</span> always stands for ‘the height of a person’ whereas <span class="math">\(h\)</span> stands for a
particular height (e.g. 180cm or 137.5cm).</p>
<p>What this means in practise is that if you have a function which deals with probability, all the arguments to that
function which are numbers should be lower-case!</p>
<p>Often this can be confusing so below, when we present some common functions, we’ll use <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> to mean ‘a
random variable’ (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math">\(H\)</span>) and <span class="math">\(\lozenge\)</span> to mean ‘the value of a random variable’ (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math">\(h\)</span>).
When using the definitions of these functions you can substitute the <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\lozenge\)</span>
appropriately.</p>
<p>Remember: <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> is just a label which tells us what random variable we’re dealing with, <span class="math">\(\lozenge\)</span>
is that variable’s actual value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-cumulative-distribution-function">
<h2>The Cumulative Distribution Function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cumulative-distribution-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is, in essence, the starting point from which everything else you’ll use in
probability derives. It is simply a function that tells us something about the value of a random variable. In fact it
tells us the probability that a random variable will have a particular value or lower. The CDF for the random variable
<span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> is defined to be:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boxed{ F_\blacklozenge(\lozenge) = P(\blacklozenge \le \lozenge) }\]</div>
<p>Recall that <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> is just a label telling us what the random variable is. We could write down the
definition of the CDF for the height of a person by simply substituting <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_H(h) = P(H \le h).\]</div>
<div class="section" id="free-variables">
<h3>Free variables<a class="headerlink" href="#free-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, it is only a convention that we use corresponding lower-case letters to denote particular values of the random
variable. The CDF for the height of a person could just as easily been written as <span class="math">\(F_H(x) = P(H \le x)\)</span>. The
important thing is that we know what random variable we’re talking about. Variables, like <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, which we are free
to re-name—assuming we do it consistently—are called <em>free variables</em>.</p>
<p>It is important to note what variables are free variables since it is often the case that a proof can be completed by
just changing an <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to a <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in the right place!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-not-just-talk-about">
<h3>Why not just talk about <span class="math">\(P(\blacklozenge = \lozenge)\)</span>?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-just-talk-about" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So why do we use <span class="math">\(P(\blacklozenge \le \lozenge)\)</span> instead of <span class="math">\(P(\blacklozenge = \lozenge)\)</span>? Well, the
answer is surprising: for many random variables the value of <span class="math">\(P(\blacklozenge = \lozenge)\)</span> is always zero!</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> is ‘the hour shown on a clock’ which we’ll call <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. If we
assume this is a usual 12-hour clock, there are 12 distinct values that <span class="math">\(C\)</span> can take.  Let’s use the frequentist
approach to calculate <span class="math">\(P(C = c)\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If we look at the clock <span class="math">\(N\)</span> times at random we’d expect on average one twelfth of the time to find that the
hour is <span class="math">\(c\)</span> so <span class="math">\(n(C = c) = N/12\)</span> if <span class="math">\(1 \le c \le 12\)</span> and zero otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The rest of the time <span class="math">\(C \ne c\)</span> and so <span class="math">\(n(C \ne c) = 11N / 12\)</span> if <span class="math">\(1 \le c \le 12\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n(C
\ne c) = N\)</span> otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using the frequentist definition of probability, therefore,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}P(C = c) = \left\{
\begin{array}{c l l}
\frac{N/12}{N/12 + 11N/12} &amp; = 1/12 &amp; \mbox{if } 1 \le c \le 12 \\
0 / N &amp; = 0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.\end{split}\]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All fine and good. But now consider <span class="math">\(\blacklozenge\)</span> being ‘the angle the hour hand makes with the vertical’, or
<span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Again consider the frequentist approach.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There is one and only one case when <span class="math">\(A = a\)</span> so <span class="math">\(n(A = a) = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>There are an infinity of angles which are not <span class="math">\(a\)</span> so <span class="math">\(n(A \ne a) = \infty\)</span>.</li>
<li>Hence <span class="math">\(P(A = a) = 1 / \infty = 0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument above justifies our assertion that some random variables end up with the probability of them taking any one
value as being zero.  To restate: there are an infinity of possible angles that the hour hand can take so, assuming them
all to be equally likely, the probability of any one of them is zero.</p>
<p>For most random variables it often makes more sense to consider the probability of them taking a <em>range</em> of values. For
example, if the hour hand has angle <span class="math">\(a\)</span> corresponding to hour <span class="math">\(c\)</span> then it follows that <span class="math">\((c-1) \times
30^\circ &lt; a \le c \times 30^\circ\)</span>. It should be possible to convince yourself it follows that</p>
<div class="math">
\[P(C = c) = P(A \le c \times 30^\circ) - P(A \le (c-1) \times 30^\circ),\]</div>
<p>or, making use of the CDF for <span class="math">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[P(C = c) = F_A(c \times 30^\circ) - F_A((c-1) \times 30^\circ).\]</div>
<p>Notice that the CDF for <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is actually useful and has a sensible value. If every position of the hour hand is
equally likely then <span class="math">\(F_A(0^\circ) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_A(360^\circ) = 1\)</span>. If we were to plot the value of
<span class="math">\(F_A\)</span> it would look something like this:</p>

<p>It is instructive to use this definition of <span class="math">\(F_A(a)\)</span> to convince yourself that it can be used to show that

<h3>The Gaussian CDF<a class="headerlink" href="#the-gaussian-cdf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is a CDF which often comes up when measuring ‘natural’ random variables (like the height of a person) called the
<em>Gaussian</em> CDF. You may also have heard it called the <em>normal distribution</em>. Let’s not worry for the moment exactly how
hit is defined, instead lets just take a look at it:</p>

</div><p>Being able to sketch the Gaussian CDF is <em>very</em> useful. We can already see some things from this picture. For instance,
there is a 0.5 probability of <span class="math">\(G \le 0\)</span>. Also there is a probability of approximately <span class="math">\(2/3\)</span> that values
are within <span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span> of zero <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. The Gaussian is well suited to random variables whose values cluster around some
central point and are spread equally either side.</p>
<p>We find the Gaussian is often a good fit for ‘natural’ random variables like the height of a person. Here is the CDF of
measured heights for women in the U.K.</p>

<p class="caption">The CDF of measured heights for women in the U.K.</p></div><p>Notice that it’s pretty much the same shape as the Gaussian. In fact we can stretch and scale the Gaussian CDF to fit
the data:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_H(h) = F_G\left( \frac{h - 163\mbox{cm}}{5\mbox{cm}} \right).\]</div>
<p>We can generalise this stretching and scaling to fit a Gaussian random variable centred on <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and with around
2/3 of the observed values within <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>. Let’s call this random variable <span class="math">\(X_g\)</span>. We can
write down the CDF for <span class="math">\(X_g\)</span> in terms of a stretched version of <span class="math">\(F_G\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boxed{ F_{X_g}(x;\mu,\sigma) = F_G\left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right) }\]</div>
<p>We term <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> the <em>mean</em> and <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> the <em>standard deviation</em>. We’ll return to these later and define them
properly but for now just think of them as knobs to control the shape of the Gaussian CDF. The random variable
<span class="math">\(G'\)</span> is still Gaussian, it’s just been stretched and scaled. We differentiate a Gaussian random variable with
<span class="math">\(\mu = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma = 1\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math">\(G\)</span>) by calling it the <em>standard</em> Gaussian.</p>
<p>We call these knobs <em>parameters</em> and we differentiate them from random variable values by putting them after a ‘;’ in
the function arguments.</p>
